# Backend Hardening Report

## Executive Summary
The backend is in good shape with Hono+tRPC, structured logging, and validation middleware. Immediate wins implemented: CORS allow-list in prod, centralized error handler, outbound timeouts/retries with a circuit breaker, env contract, and docs. Remaining risk: in-memory rate limits (single-process), and lack of Redis-backed limits in prod.

## Findings
- Security: CORS was wildcard; now allow-list in prod. Centralized error mapping added. JWT verified in tRPC context. Logs use PII redactors.
- Reliability: Added `fetchWithTimeout` with retries/backoff and circuit breaker; upstream proxy and STT integrated. Health/info endpoints present and documented.
- Performance: Minimal overhead; retry/backoff defaults are conservative.
- DX: Added backend scripts; env example; docs with architecture/ops/test plan.

## Tests
- Existing tests cover validation and rate limit middleware; add backend tests for health/info, tRPC happy/invalid, STT validation, and upstream failure (pending additions).
- Coverage target: 80%+ overall, backend included in Jest config.

## CI
- Multiple CI workflows exist (bun/npm). Recommend adding a backend job aliasing `backend:*` scripts. Semgrep and Codecov already configured.

## Diff Summary
- `backend/hono.ts`: CORS allow-list; centralized onError/notFound; info endpoint metadata
- `backend/lib/http.ts`: new retry/timeout/circuit breaker
- `backend/routes/toolkitProxy.ts`, `backend/routes/stt.ts`: use fetchWithTimeout
- `.env.example` and docs: BE-ARCH/TEST-PLAN/OPERATIONS/SECURITY-CHECKLIST/PLAN/REPORT
- `package.json`: backend scripts

## Next Steps
- Swap in-memory rate limiter for Redis in prod
- Add more auth and failure-path tests with MSW
- Wire OpenAPI or type snapshot docs
