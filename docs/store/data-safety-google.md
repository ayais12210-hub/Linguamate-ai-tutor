## 3. Security Practices

- **Data Encryption:**  
  - All data in transit is protected with HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.  
  - Any locally stored practice clips are encrypted on device storage.  

- **Least Privilege Access:**  
  - App requests microphone permission only when the user explicitly taps ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù.  
  - No background microphone or storage access.  

- **Secure Storage:**  
  - Diagnostic and analytics data stored by service providers is encrypted at rest.  
  - No secrets are hardcoded into the app.

## 4. User Controls & Rights

- **Consent & Controls:**  
  - Analytics and diagnostics are **opt-in** (disabled by default in privacy-conscious regions).  
  - Microphone access must be explicitly granted per platform.  

- **Data Deletion:**  
  - Users can delete all saved practice clips in-app at any time.  
  - Users can request data export or deletion by contacting:  
    **privacy@linguamate.ai**  

- **Transparency:**  
  - Privacy Policy is always accessible in-app and via store listing.  
  - Clear in-app privacy settings under *Profile ‚Üí Privacy Controls*.

## 5. Retention Policy

- **Audio:**  
  - Real-time transcription audio discarded immediately after processing.  
  - Saved practice clips remain only on the device until manually deleted by the user.  

- **Diagnostics:**  
  - Retained for 90 days, then automatically purged.  

- **Analytics:**  
  - Retained in aggregate form (non-identifying) as per provider retention policy (typically 12‚Äì24 months).
