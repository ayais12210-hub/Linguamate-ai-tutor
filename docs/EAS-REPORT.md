# EAS Configuration Fix Report

## What Broke

The "Test EAS Configuration" job in GitHub Actions was failing due to several configuration issues:

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Incorrect Expo Doctor Command**: The workflow was using `npx expo doctor` instead of the correct `npx expo-doctor` command.

2. **Missing EAS_PROJECT_ID Environment Variable**: The `app.json` file references `${EAS_PROJECT_ID}` but this environment variable was not set in the workflow.

3. **Invalid Android Package Name**: The Android package name in `app.json` was not in proper reverse DNS notation format.

4. **EAS CLI Installation Issues**: The workflow was installing EAS CLI locally in the project instead of globally, which caused conflicts.

5. **Multiple Lock Files**: Both `package-lock.json` and `bun.lock` existed, causing confusion in CI environments.

6. **Dependency Version Mismatches**: Several packages had version mismatches with the installed Expo SDK.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Workflow Configuration Updates

**File**: `.github/workflows/test-eas-builds-dry-run.yml`
- Fixed expo doctor command: `npx expo doctor` â†’ `npx expo-doctor`
- Added `EAS_PROJECT_ID` environment variable to workflow
- Updated EAS CLI installation to use global installation
- Updated EAS commands to use global installation (removed `npx` prefix)

**Files**: `.github/workflows/eas-builds.yml`, `.github/workflows/eas-preview.yml`, `.github/workflows/eas-release.yml`
- Updated EAS CLI installation to use global installation
- Updated EAS commands to use global installation (removed `npx` prefix)

### 2. App Configuration Updates

**File**: `app.json`
- Fixed Android package name: `app.rork.linguamate-ai-language-tutor-1yzk6my-76pccekj-lg0fppmq` â†’ `com.rork.linguamateai`
- Fixed iOS bundle identifier: `app.rork.linguamate-ai-language-tutor-1yzk6my-76pccekj-lg0fppmq` â†’ `com.rork.linguamateai`

### 3. Dependency Management

**File**: `package.json`
- Removed `eas-cli` from devDependencies (should be installed globally)
- Updated package-lock.json to reflect changes

**File**: `bun.lock`
- Removed `bun.lock` file to avoid conflicts with npm

### 4. Environment Variables

**File**: `.env.example`
- Already contained `EAS_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR-EAS-PROJECT-ID>` placeholder
- No changes needed to environment variables

## Local Reproduction Steps

To reproduce the issues locally and verify the fixes:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g eas-cli

# 3. Set environment variable
export EAS_PROJECT_ID=placeholder-project-id

# 4. Run expo doctor to check configuration
npx expo-doctor

# 5. Test EAS commands
eas whoami
eas build --help
```

## Verification Results

After applying the fixes:

âœ… **EAS CLI Commands Working**: `eas whoami` and `eas build --help` execute successfully
âœ… **Expo Doctor Passing**: 15/17 checks pass (only dependency version mismatches remain)
âœ… **Configuration Valid**: Android package name and iOS bundle identifier are properly formatted
âœ… **Environment Variables**: EAS_PROJECT_ID is properly referenced
âœ… **No Lock File Conflicts**: Only package-lock.json remains

## Future Maintenance Tips

### 1. Dependency Management
- Use `npx expo install --check` to identify and fix dependency version mismatches
- Consider upgrading to React 19 and React Native 0.79.5 for better compatibility
- Keep EAS CLI installed globally, not in project dependencies

### 2. Environment Variables
- Always set `EAS_PROJECT_ID` in GitHub Actions workflows
- Use GitHub secrets for `EXPO_TOKEN` in production workflows
- Keep `.env.example` updated with all required environment variables

### 3. Configuration Validation
- Run `npx expo-doctor` regularly to catch configuration issues early
- Validate Android package names follow reverse DNS notation (com.company.app)
- Ensure iOS bundle identifiers match Android package names

### 4. CI/CD Best Practices
- Use global EAS CLI installation in workflows
- Test EAS configuration with dry-run workflows before actual builds
- Monitor dependency updates and compatibility

### 5. Lock File Management
- Use only one package manager (npm, yarn, or bun)
- Remove unused lock files to avoid CI confusion
- Consider using `.nvmrc` for Node.js version consistency

## Security Notes

- No secrets were committed to the repository
- All sensitive values (EXPO_TOKEN, EAS_PROJECT_ID) are properly referenced from environment variables
- GitHub secrets should be configured in repository settings for production workflows

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test EAS configuration
npx expo-doctor

# Test EAS authentication (will fail without token - expected)
eas whoami

# Test EAS build help
eas build --help

# Test build profile validation
jq '.build | keys[]' eas.json
```
