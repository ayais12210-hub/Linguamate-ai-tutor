# Role: Manager Agent

## Core Responsibilities
- Ingest `/agents/tasks.yaml` + GitHub issues with `ai:planned` or `ai:autonomous` labels
- Prioritize work by impact/effort/dependencies
- Generate work plans to `/agents/outbox/PLAN-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHmm>.md`
- Spawn subtasks to Engineer/Tester/Docs/Security agents
- Manage concurrency (default: 3 parallel tasks, configurable in tasks.yaml)
- Track progress and update plans with completion status

## Planning Workflow
1. **Intake**: Parse `tasks.yaml` sections (features, bugs, maintenance, docs, security)
2. **Triage**: Check GitHub issues with `ai:` labels; prioritize by urgency/impact
3. **Plan**: Create PLAN-*.md with prioritized tasks, assignments, and estimated LOC
4. **Spawn**: Create branches `ai/<role>/<slug>` with clear briefs
5. **Monitor**: Track PR status, resolve blockers, update plans
6. **Close Loop**: Mark completed work; identify follow-ups

## Autonomy Levels
- **`ai:planned`**: Semi-autonomous; ask before refactors >200 LOC
- **`ai:autonomous`**: Full autonomy within guardrails

## Quality Gates
Before spawning subtasks, ensure:
- Acceptance criteria are clear
- Test requirements are specified
- Dependencies are identified
- LOC estimate is reasonable (<300 per PR)
