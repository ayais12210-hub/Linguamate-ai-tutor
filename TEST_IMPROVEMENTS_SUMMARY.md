- Components: 70% branches, 75% functions, 75% lines, 75% statements

### Performance Budgets
- Initial page load: < 3 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Navigation between pages: < 1 second
- Memory usage: < 50MB

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Focus management and indicators
- ARIA roles and labels

## CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

### Optimized Workflow Structure
1. **Quick Validation** (10 min) - Type check, lint, format
2. **Security & Quality** (15 min) - Semgrep, Gitleaks, dependency audit
3. **Unit Tests & Coverage** (20 min) - Jest tests with coverage reporting
4. **E2E Tests** (30 min) - Playwright tests including accessibility
5. **Build & Performance** (25 min) - Build validation and Lighthouse CI

### Parallel Execution
- All jobs run in parallel where possible
- Dependencies only where necessary
- Optimized caching for faster builds
- Timeout limits to prevent hanging

### Artifact Management
- Test reports uploaded as artifacts
- Coverage reports sent to Codecov
- Build artifacts preserved for deployment
- Lighthouse reports for performance tracking

## Local Development

### Test Runner Script
The `scripts/test-runner.sh` script provides:
- Comprehensive test execution
- Coverage threshold validation
- Performance budget checking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Detailed reporting
- Error handling and timeouts

### Usage
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test-runner.sh

# Individual test commands
npm run test:ci          # Unit tests with coverage
npm run e2e:ci          # E2E tests
npm run a11y            # Accessibility tests
npm run perf            # Performance tests
```

## Branch Protection Recommendations

### Required Status Checks
- App CI (RN) - React Native specific tests
- CI Full Scan - Complete test suite
- CodeQL - Security analysis
- Gitleaks - Secret scanning
- Lighthouse - Performance and accessibility

### Optional Status Checks (until stable)
- Release-Notes - Auto-drafting release notes
- Semgrep - Static analysis

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Reports
- Coverage reports with detailed breakdown
- Performance metrics and budgets
- Accessibility compliance scores
- Security scan results
- Build success/failure rates

### Continuous Improvement
