# Testing Infrastructure Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the testing infrastructure of the Linguamate AI Tutor project.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. TypeScript Global Type Definitions

**Problem**: The test suite was failing due to missing TypeScript definitions for React Native global variables like `__DEV__`.

**Solution**: 
- Created `types/global.d.ts` with proper TypeScript definitions for React Native globals
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include the new type definitions
- Modified test files to use proper type casting for global variable access

**Files Modified**:
- `types/global.d.ts` (new file)
- `tsconfig.json`
- `lib/__tests__/secure-key-manager.test.ts`
- `tests/config/jest.setup.ts`

### 2. Dependency Version Alignment

**Problem**: Version mismatch between expected and installed `react-test-renderer` versions causing test failures.

**Solution**: Updated `package.json` to align with the actually installed version (19.2.0).

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json`

### 3. Missing Development Dependencies

**Problem**: Missing `ts-node` dependency required for TypeScript Jest configuration.

**Solution**: Added `ts-node` as a development dependency.

**Dependencies Added**:
- `ts-node@^10.9.2`
- `expo-secure-store@15.0.7` (for test mocking)

## Implementation Details

### Global Type Definitions

The new `types/global.d.ts` file provides TypeScript definitions for:
- `__DEV__`: React Native development mode flag
- `__METRO__`: Metro bundler development flag
- `__EXPO_DEV__`: Expo development flag

These definitions are properly scoped to both the global namespace and NodeJS.Global interface.

### Jest Configuration Improvements

Enhanced the Jest setup file (`tests/config/jest.setup.ts`) to:
- Properly initialize React Native global variables
- Set up `__DEV__` based on NODE_ENV
- Use type-safe global variable assignments

### Test File Improvements

Updated test files to use proper TypeScript patterns:
- Type casting for global variable access: `(global as any).__DEV__`
- Proper mock setup for Expo dependencies
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Benefits

1. **Improved Type Safety**: All global variables now have proper TypeScript definitions
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and proper IDE support
3. **Consistent Testing Environment**: Reliable setup across different development environments
4. **Maintainable Code**: Well-documented type definitions and setup procedures

## Testing

The improvements have been tested with:
- Individual test file execution
- TypeScript compilation checks
- Dependency resolution verification

## Future Recommendations

1. **Expand Test Coverage**: Add more comprehensive tests for React Native specific functionality
2. **Add E2E Testing**: Implement end-to-end tests for critical user workflows
3. **Performance Testing**: Add performance benchmarks for key operations
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Expand accessibility test coverage

## Migration Guide

For developers working on this project:

1. The new global type definitions are automatically included via `tsconfig.json`
2. Use `(global as any).__DEV__` pattern when accessing React Native globals in tests
3. Ensure all new Expo dependencies are properly mocked in test files
4. Follow the established patterns in `tests/config/jest.setup.ts` for global setup

This improvement provides a solid foundation for the project's testing infrastructure and ensures reliable test execution across different environments.
