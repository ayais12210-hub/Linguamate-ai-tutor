# 🔐 Security Overview — Linguamate AI

This document provides a **centralized overview** of the security posture for Linguamate AI across **Android, iOS, and Web** platforms.  
It serves as the entry point for all platform-specific security policies and practices.  

All measures are aligned with:
- **OWASP MASVS** (Mobile Application Security Verification Standard)  
- **OWASP Top 10 (Web Applications)**  
- **Google Play Data Safety Guidelines**  
- **Apple App Store Privacy Guidelines**  
- **GDPR / CCPA compliance**

## 📱 Mobile Security (Android + iOS)

### Shared Principles
- Transport Security: HTTPS/TLS 1.2+, HSTS enforced, no mixed content.  
- Secrets Management: never stored in client; injected via environment/config.  
- Permissions: **least privilege** — only microphone is requested, and only when triggered.  
- Logging: no PII or tokens in logs.  
- Privacy: analytics and crash reporting are optional and opt-in.  
- Data Deletion: users can request deletion in-app or via support email.

- [Security Notes — iOS](./SECURITY_IOS.md)

## 🌐 Web Security

### Core Principles
- HTTPS/TLS enforced with **HSTS** and redirect rules.  
- Strong **Content Security Policy (CSP)** restricts origins and prevents XSS.  
- No secrets in client code; only `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` env vars exposed.  
- Backend APIs hardened with rate limiting, input validation, and safe error handling.  
- Authentication tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies (preferred).  
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards checked in CI.

- [Security Notes — Web](./SECURITY_WEB.md)

## 📊 Observability & Monitoring
- Correlation IDs for tracing requests end-to-end.  
- Redaction of tokens and sensitive data in logs.  
- Crash reporting (Sentry/Expo) optional, anonymized.  
- Lighthouse + Playwright security checks automated in CI/CD.

## ⚠️ Incident Response
- 📧 **Contact:** `security@linguamate.ai`  
- 🛠 **Steps:**  
  1. **Identify**: Detect via monitoring alerts.  
  2. **Contain**: Revoke compromised tokens, disable endpoints.  
  3. **Notify**: Inform affected users (if legally required).  
  4. **Remediate**: Patch, redeploy, rotate secrets.  
- 🕒 SLA: Critical vulnerabilities → triaged in 4h, patched in ≤48h.  

---

## 📋 Compliance
- GDPR & CCPA transparency: Privacy Policy accessible in-app and on website.  
- Google Play Data Safety: microphone optional, no unnecessary permissions.  
- Apple App Store Privacy Nutrition Labels: accurate, no hidden data use.  
- Cookie consent banner (for Web, if analytics enabled).  
- Regular penetration testing and dependency scanning (npm audit, Semgrep, Gitleaks).  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Android: Play Integrity API device attestation.  
- iOS: Certificate pinning + App Attest for fraud prevention.  
- Web: Subresource Integrity (SRI) + CSP reporting endpoints.  
- All: scheduled penetration tests, red team exercises before major releases.
