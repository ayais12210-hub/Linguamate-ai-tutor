Here‚Äôs a comprehensively expanded ‚ÄúData Safety Mapping (Android)‚Äù doc ‚Äî written in the exact format Google Play Console expects, but with more detail and clarity so you can copy-paste confidently. I‚Äôve built it to match Linguamate‚Äôs actual flows and future-proof it if you later add account creation or premium billing.

üìã Data Safety Mapping (Android)

This document maps Linguamate‚Äôs in-app data flows to the Google Play Data Safety form.
It should be updated whenever new features or SDKs are integrated.

1. Collected Data Types

Personal info

Email address: Only if user creates an account (not required in current anonymous flow).

No other personal identifiers collected by default.


Audio

Microphone recordings: Collected when user initiates speech-to-text.

Processed server-side, discarded after transcription.


App activity

General in-app interactions (screen views, lesson completions, quiz scores, chat usage).

Aggregated and non-identifying.


Diagnostics

Crash logs and performance metrics (device type, OS version, error traces).

Used for debugging and stability improvements.


Device / Other identifiers

Random session IDs or correlation IDs generated in app.

No persistent device identifiers (IMEI, MAC address, Advertising ID) are collected.

2. Data Handling

Encryption in transit: All data sent via HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.

Encryption at rest: Backend databases and storage are encrypted at rest.

Data deletion:

Anonymous users: audio and logs discarded per retention policy.

If accounts are added: users may request deletion via in-app settings or support email.


No sale of data: Data is never sold to third parties.



---

3. Purposes of Collection

App functionality

Speech-to-text transcription (microphone recordings).

Personalisation of lessons/quizzes.

Progress tracking and XP rewards.


Analytics

Aggregate interaction patterns for feature improvement.

Crash and performance metrics for app stability.


Security & compliance

Rate limiting, abuse detection, and fraud prevention.

Moderation of AI prompts/outputs (server-side).




---

4. Sharing

Third-party processors only

Hosting providers (e.g. cloud infrastructure).

Analytics tools (e.g. Expo/React Native telemetry, crash reporting).


Bound by DPA (Data Processing Agreements).

No sale or marketing use.



---

5. Retention

Audio uploads: Kept only during active transcription request; discarded immediately after processing.

App activity & analytics: Retained in aggregate form per analytics provider‚Äôs standard policy (typically 12‚Äì24 months).

Diagnostics: Retained for debugging for up to 18 months.

Personal info (if account system added): Retained until account is deleted or support deletion request is fulfilled.



---

6. Permissions

RECORD_AUDIO

Purpose: Speech-to-text.

Requested only in-context (user taps microphone).

Explicit rationale displayed before permission prompt.

No background microphone access.


INTERNET

Required for API requests (tRPC, AI endpoints).


ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE

Used to detect offline/online state for caching.


WRITE/READ_STORAGE (scoped only, if any)

Used by React Native/Expo for caching assets in app sandbox.

No broad file system access.




---

7. Compliance Notes

Children: App targets 13+; no child-directed data collection.

Sensitive categories: No collection of contacts, calendar, SMS, or location.

Transparency: Privacy policy and terms linked both in-app and on Play listing.

Future readiness: If premium billing is added, only purchase tokens are processed through Google Play Billing.

‚úÖ This version is aligned with Google Play Data Safety form sections: Collected Data, Purpose, Sharing, Retention, Security, Permissions.
It also avoids grey areas (like ‚Äúmay collect Advertising ID‚Äù) since Linguamate doesn‚Äôt rely on ads.
