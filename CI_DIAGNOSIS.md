# CI Diagnosis Report

## Summary
The CI pipeline is failing due to multiple interconnected issues. The main problems are:

1. **ESLint**: Passes but uses legacy config
2. **TypeScript**: 50+ type errors, mainly around ZodError.errors property and Result type mismatches
3. **Jest/Tests**: Missing dependencies (@testing-library/dom), incorrect test setup, Playwright tests running in Jest
4. **Semgrep**: Not configured (will address in workflow fixes)
5. **CodeQL**: Not configured (will address in workflow fixes)

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. TypeScript Configuration Issues
- ZodError.errors property doesn't exist (should be ZodError.issues)
- Result type definitions are inconsistent across the codebase
- Missing proper type declarations for React Native/Expo

### 2. Jest Configuration Issues
- Missing @testing-library/dom dependency
- Playwright tests being run by Jest
- Incorrect test environment setup for React Native

### 3. Missing Dependencies
- @testing-library/dom
- Proper ESLint configuration for TypeScript path resolution
